In this directory is a PKGBUILD. Please use the following checklist to check it for safety and correctness:

- [ ] Verify that all sources are controlled by the original developers. Provide URLs for the resources you used.
- [ ] Verify that the actual sources are not subtly different from the correct source, either by misspelling or obfuscation.
- [ ] Ensure that no part of the build downloads files or connects to the internet aside from the source specifications.
- [ ] Look for code obfuscation of any kind.
- [ ] If there are additional files provided by the packager, check them and regard with suspicion. (Disregard log files and previous versions of this package if they are present.)
- [ ] Look for oddities or deviations from convention and best practice.
- [ ] Look for non-malicious mistakes or misconfigurations that may cause problems or vulnerabilites.
- [ ] Look for anything at all that might affect my decision to build and install this package.

Do not elaborate on passing checklist items.
