I'm going to ask you one or more questions, please create a markdown document with the best answers you can find.

- Give the document a descriptive name.
- Only answer the questions, providing context if necessary.
- Don't provide a comprehensive summary of the documentation.
- Don't begin planning the implementation.
- When answering a question, provide a URL to the source you used.
- Prioritize the official documentation. If those don't have a good answer, you can use well known blogs and sites such as MDN or css-tricks. If those don't have a good answer, it's perfectly ok to say "I don't know" or to question the premise of the original question.

Question(s) follow:
